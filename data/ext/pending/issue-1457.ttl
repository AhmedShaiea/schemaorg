At a minimum a schedule will specify [[repeatFrequency]] which describes the interval between occurences of the event. Additional information can be provided to specify the schedule more precisely.
      This includes identifying the day(s) of the week or month when the recurring event will take place, in addition to its start and end time. Schedules may also

      gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An [[Event]] that
      is associated with a [[Schedule]] using this property should not have [[startDate]] or [[endDate]] properties. These are instead defined within the associated
